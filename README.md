### Data & Modeling:
- Dataset: product_sales_region (1500 rows) covering the store location, customer type, payment method, promotion code, etc. 
- Tools: MySQL LAG window function, DATEDIFF,  aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX ), ALTER TABLE (ADD), Data Manipulation Language (MODIFY), Numeric function (ROUND), etc.
- Approach: corrected the order date column after getting the irregular date results when queried, applied the LAG window function to calculate year-over-year changes in growth percentage, and compared stores in various locations and regions for sales aspects.

### Sample SQL Highlights: -- Total amount of the discount offered to the customers using promotion codes
                        SELECT 
                            AVG(DATEDIFF(DeliveryDate, OrderDate)) AS avg_delivery_days
                        FROM product_sales_region
                        WHERE DeliveryDate IS NOT NULL 
                          AND OrderDate IS NOT NULL
                        ;            
                             

### Recommendations:
| Stakeholder | Recommended Action | Expected Impact |
|------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| **Store Management** | Reduce reliance on blanket discounts; invest in targeted **marketing & advertising campaigns** to drive sustainable demand. | Higher brand visibility, improved customer acquisition without eroding margins. | 
| **Operations & Merchandising** | Tailor **product mix by region** (e.g., tablets in the West/Central, laptops in the South, desks in the North). | Better alignment with local demand, reduced inventory waste, and higher sell‑through rates. |
| **Customer Experience Teams** |  Introduce **after‑sales services** (repairs, spare parts) and loyalty programs to strengthen retention. | New revenue streams, improved customer lifetime value, stronger brand loyalty. | 
| **Finance & Pricing Teams** | Concentrate **discounts/promotions in Q1** to leverage seasonal demand spikes, while monitoring ROI. | Boost quarterly sales while maintaining profitability across the year. | 
| **Digital & Payments** | Expand **online payment options** and streamline checkout processes. | Faster transactions, improved convenience, higher conversion rates. |
| **Quality Assurance** | Investigate high **laptop return rates** and implement stricter quality checks or extended warranties. | Lower return costs, improved customer satisfaction, and stronger trust in product quality. |
| **Executive Leadership** | Monitor **Store D’s heavy discounting** and set profitability thresholds; benchmark Store A’s product variety strategy. | Balanced growth across stores, reduced margin pressure, scalable best practices. |


### Limitations & Next Steps:
- Data is limited for 2025 for sales data.
- Some discounts given to customers had a null promotion code.
- Future: In-depth analysis with complete data for the year 2025, integrating Python/Power BI for interactive dashboards or ML predictions.
